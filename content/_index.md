Hi there, I’m Sam. I’m a software engineer at Brookhaven National Laboratory's Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider on Long Island, New York. I work to develop intuitive human interfaces for three large-scale particle accelerators, and provide support for physicists, technicians, & users of these machines. I’m currently living outside of Chicago with my fiance and our rapidly growing assortment of houseplants.

I graduated from Stony Brook University with my Bachelor’s of Science in Computer Science in 2019. While there, I put a focus on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, taking courses covering the theory and application of the fields. Starting in the fall of 2021, I began working towards a Master’s of Science in Computer Science at Georgia Institute of Technology with a specialization in Computing Systems. I graduated from that program in December 2023, after two years of hard work - it was almost its own full-time job. 

Outside of my career, I have an immense love of cooking. Food has always been a big part of my life, but not always something that was considered “cuisine.” Working 9-to-5 has shown me the importance of finding recipes which are equally time-efficient and delicious. The dishes I love span numerous cultures and palates, but are universally fulfilling. Plus, having such a broad array of inspiration creates delicious new creations out of my kitchen!
