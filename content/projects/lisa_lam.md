title: Makeup Portfolio Development

A close friend approached me with the opportunity to design a maintainable, extensible digital portfolio for her blossoming makeup artistry business.
To simplify the development process, I opted for a Wordpress base which would allow her to maintain the site occasionally without my involvement - uploading new photos and client recommendations.

In addition to the portfolio website, she was setup a business email with webmail management, custom domain, and included security services. All services are hosted on a secure and private server, managed by myself.
