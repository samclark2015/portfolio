This insanely delicious recipe is thanks to [The Simple Veganista](https://simple-veganista.com/mushroom-bourguignon_10/). It makes a quick and hearty dinner for two, with lots of umami and entirely vegan ingredients.

## Ingredients
- 1 Tbsp olive oil
- 2 containers of white mushrooms
- 1 large carrot
- 1 medium yellow onion
- 4 cloves of garlic
- 3 tablespoons tomato paste
- 1 cup red wine
- 2 cups vegetable broth
- Dried thyme
- Dried oregano
- Salt & pepper
- 2 Tbsp white flour or corn starch
- 1 large sweet potato
- Fresh green beans

## Instructions
1. Prepare the mushrooms by slicing into 1/4â€³ slices. Make sure they are clean and fresh before getting to it! No dirt belongs in this dish.
2. Dice carrot and onion into 1/4â€³ cubes. This does not have to be perfect or uniform, but I like the look of a nice neat dice.
3. Finely mince the garlic.
4. On the stove, heat a dutch oven or deep sautÃ© pan with 1 Tbsp of olive oil on medium heat. When hot and shimmering, add mushrooms reserving 1/4 for later. Cook until slightly golden, 2-3 minutes.
5. Add carrot, onion, and garlic. Stir to combine and allow to sautÃ© for 2 minutes until slightly cooked but not brown.
6. Add the tomato paste, stirring to coat vegetables. Slowly add the red wine, stirring to dissolve the tomato paste. Allow to simmer for 1 minute or until mostly evaporated.
7. Season with thyme, oregano, salt, and pepper. Make sure to give it a taste!
8. Add the veggie broth, stirring to combine. Keep on medium heat until hot, then reduce to a simmer and cover loosely. Cook for 15 minutes.
9. At this point, preheat your oven or air fryer to 375ÂºF, dice your sweet potato into small cubes, and prepare your green beans.
10. Toss the potato and beans in enough olive oil to coat, and place in oven or air fryer to cook until tender, about 10 minutes.
11. After the 15 minutes, your sauce should be thicker but not dry at this point. If itâ€™s too thick, add a splash of water.
12. Add the remaining mushrooms, and flour dissolved in an equal amount of cold water. Stir and bring back to a simmer.
13. Reduce heat to low and allow to cook, loosely covered, for 10 minutes.
14. When all are done, simple plate in a wide, large-rimmed bowl (or whatever you have on hand!) and enjoy your meal. ðŸ˜‹
